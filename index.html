        <li>Mental illness is NOT your fault, but a medical condition and a product of your biology and, therefore, not the result of one or multiple life events (although major life events can trigger them).</li> 
        <li>Seeking help is NOT a sign of weakness, but strength.</li>
        <li> Mental illness is very hard to identify. It may seem that the person is perfectly fine and full of enthusiasm from the outside. On the inside, however, they may suffer unimaginable mental suffering.</li>
